Just get to the point.
What should I do?
Don't rush me.
I'm totallly burned out.
Don't be rdidiculous.
Let's face it.
Don't take it personally.
You can count on me.
I wish I could, but I can't.
I'm not in the mood.
That's a good point.
I'm booked solid.
What do you want from me?
Keep your voice down.
That makes sense.
Act your age!
Easy does it.
Can I get you something?
Have we met before?
I'm not getting involved.
I'm swamped.
I'm sorry to hear that.
You are not yourself.
What a shame.
I have a bad cough.
That never happed to me.
Are you serious?
I get your point.
Want to come along?
I can't take it anymore.
I owe you one.
Please spread the word.
I knew you would see it my way.
You've got to be kidding!
You look better in person.
I was just wondering.
You're all dressed up.
Pull yourself together.
Talk to you soon.
I already have plans.
When can you make it?
You'll newver get away with it.
You never know.
Let me ask you something..
Hang in there.
It happes all the time.
That's no big deal.
That's the way it is.
What do you take for me?
He's obsessed with me.
That's not how it works.
I will have the same.
You want to grab a bite to eat?
That's what you think.
Don't fall for it.
Are you seeing someone?
He's out of your league.
Way to go.
Sorry to hear that.
I'm looking forward to it.
You remind me of him.
Get off my back.
The shoe is on the other foot.
Get in line.
Think nothing of it.
Could I leave a message?
Keep in touch.
Can I talk to you for a second?
I will do my best.
Can you give me a hand?
I can't handle it anymore.
Are you with me?
How long have I got?
I'm going to miss you.
Who do you think you are?
Cut it out.
Too good to be true.
I'm crazy about you.
Mind your own business!
How do I look?
He's really my type.
It was my mistake.
I'm on duty.
Can't hurt to try.
It's none of your business.
Get out of here!
Time to call it a day.
I'm not kidding.
Sounds like a plan.
Let's get it over with.
How have you been?
Don't work too hard.
Don't wait up for me.
It's time to go.
It's up to you.
Don't give it a second thought.
Don's ask for trouble.
I'm with you.
Don't take it personally.
That's no excuse.
It's on me.
What else is new?
What's the weather like?
I may have over-reacted a little bit.
knock it off!
What a small world!
I'll give you a ride.
Got a minute?
You rock!
This is just between you and me.
The way I see it.
I got stood up.
I can see that.
Catch you later.
Just looking.
Don't play dumb.
Where am I?
I overreacted.
put yourself in my shoes.
I have to go.
Don't let it bother you.
It's better than nothing.
I stayed up all night.
That's not the point.
Don't waste your time.
You must have a secret admirer.
Give it a try.
What have you been up to?
I won't let it happen again.
I will put in a good word for you.
How should I know?
Coming through.
I can handle it.
I'm on your side.
That's anybody's guess.
It's coming up.
You must be late for something.
I will get right on it.
It's been a long time.
What are you talking about?
Woudld you care to join us?
Watch your tongue!
You don't wanna do it.
Give my best to your folks.
I have no problem with that.
What's going on?
Dont's let me down.
Is this a bad time?
I have no idea.
What's the big deal?
Leave me alone.
What's the bottom line?
Stop saying that!
I'd better get going.
Bundle up.
Don't get me wrong.
I don't know how to tell you this.
Where should I put this?
You know what I mean?
Look on the bright side.
I really appreciate this.
Good for you.
I have nothing to do with this.
It's good to see you again.
You can take my word for it.
Just for fun.
Don't be so dramatic.
Remember your manners.
Could you excuse us?
Keep going.
I should pay more attention.
You're not supposed to do that.
Do you have a problem with that?
I'm acutally jealous of you.
That's weird.
I got dumped.
I got too mush on my platter.
I've got a question for you.
One way or another.
Couldn't be better.
I think I will pass.
That's easier said than done.
This is typical of you!
Save my seat.
Why would you say that?
What's the difference?
We broke up.
That's another story.
Don't be so sensitive.
Look at you.
He's not husband material.
I must be going.
I'm working on it.
I'm in the middle of something.
What do you mean by that?
We're not done here.
What's the matter with you?
